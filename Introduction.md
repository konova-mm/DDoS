 ## What is DoS Attack?

``` DOS is an attack used to deny legitimate users access to a resource such as accessing a website, network, emails, etc. or making it extremely slow. DoS is the acronym for Denial of Service. This type of attack is usually implemented by hitting the target resource such as a web server with too many requests at the same time. This results in the server failing to respond to all the requests. The effect of this can either be crashing the servers or slowing them down. ```

#### DoS – this type of attack is performed by a single host
#### Distributed DoS– this type of attack is performed by a number of compromised machines that all target the same victim. It floods the network with data packets.
